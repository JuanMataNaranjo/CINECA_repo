Welcome to snakemake_log_analysis's documentation!
==================================================

This is the most important part of a documentation theme. If you like
the general look of the theme, please make sure that it is possible to
easily navigate through this sample documentation.

Ideally, the pages listed below should also be reachable via links
somewhere else on this page (like the sidebar, or a topbar). If they are
not, then this theme might need additional configuration to provide the
sort of site navigation that's necessary for "real" documentation.
